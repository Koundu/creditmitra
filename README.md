Troubleshooting
---------------

*   **Form Not Displaying Properly**: Ensure you have included the correct paths for styles.css and that the file is located in the same directory as index.html.
    
*   **Form Submission**: This application does not have a backend, so form submission will not process any data. To implement submission functionality, server-side logic or JavaScript can be added.
